# NixOS config

## Introduction

Keeping both system wide config and my user config together.  Not ideal, but it's the Belgian compromise for a single-user system.


## Config

- [x] reproducible automated builds, every time
- [x] reproducible settings (git, vim, ..)
- [x] pinned virtualbox (flakes, not channels)
